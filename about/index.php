						<h1>GuildWars2 Wardrobe</h1>
						<p>Welcome to GuildWars2 Wardrobe! This is an online tool that will help you guys figuring out how to get your dirty, little hands on all the armor and weapon items this game has to offer. It all started when I asked <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/22e0mm/what_kind_of_online_tool_do_you_miss/">Reddit what kind of online tool they would like to see made</a>. The overwhelming 6 upvotes made me appreciate the great community <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/">/r/GuildWars2</a> is! A friendly user named <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Moonfishie">/u/Moonfishie</a> came up with this great suggestion.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>When the new wardrobe UI comes out, I'd love to go to a site/app that lets me click a slot in the wardrobe to display info on how that skin is obtained.</p>
							<footer><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Moonfishie">/u/Moonfishie</a></footer>
						</blockquote>
						<p>I thought this was a great idea, and quickly started the development. This tool is built on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html">Knockout JS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy">GW2Spidy</a> and <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main">GuildWars2's official API</a>.</p>

						<h1>The author</h1>
						<p>Let's not be strangers, so allow me to talk a little bit about me. My name is Christian Grimsgaard. I am a 23 year old guy from Norway with a bachelor's degree in Web Development from <a href="www.hig.no">Gj√∏vik University College</a>. I am currently studying for a master's degree in Interaction Design, but as this study does not involve any development, I crave for fun side projects once in a while. Other than the typical nerdy computer stuff, I love diving and golfing, and I have in many occations proved to be a social guy. I tell terrible jokes, and I'm a huge fan of movies and TV shows. I naturally identify myself with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071/">Will Ferrell</a>, the most handsome actor of them all.</p>
						<p>If you would like to contact me for some reason, you can either <a href="mailto:mail (at) christiangrimsgaard.net">mail me</a> or whisper me ingame (IGN: nightzirch.3126, main character is Elriwun Awesome).</p>
